# Higgs Boson


- standard model, give an overview of the fundamental particles
- what makes higgs special and detection difficult
- production modes from higgs- ggH, VBF, etc
- different decay modes of higgs, use PDG for getting the branching ratio
- explain the different flavour (electron and muon) final state
- what introduce backgrounds in the process and how to overcome them.
