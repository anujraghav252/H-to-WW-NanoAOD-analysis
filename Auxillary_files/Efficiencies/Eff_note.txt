--------------------------Trigger Efficiency: -------------------------

Efficiency: 91.29 %

Triggers used: HLT_Mu12_TrkIsoVVL_Ele23_CaloIdL_TrackIdL_IsoVL_DZ and HLT_Mu23_TrkIsoVVL_Ele12_CaloIdL_TrackIdL_IsoVL_DZ


Kinematic cuts used for calculation: 

1. Object Selection (Tight Leptons)

Electrons
Identification: Electron_mvaFall17V2Iso_WP90 == True (MVA ID with 90% efficiency working point)

Muons
Identification: Muon_tightId == True
Isolation: Muon_pfRelIso04_all < 0.15 (Tight PF Isolation)


2. Event Selection

Pre-Selection
Lepton Count: Exactly 2 "Tight" leptons.
Flavor: Opposite Flavor (Electron + Muon).
Charge: Opposite Charge (q1 × q2 < 0).


3. Kinematic Cuts

Lepton Kinematics
Leading Lepton pT: > 25 GeV
Subleading Lepton pT: > 13 GeV
Note: This is currently set to 13 GeV in the file, not 15 GeV.

Pseudorapidity (eta): |eta| < 2.5 for both Electrons and Muons.
Note: The split cut (Muon < 2.4, Electron < 2.5) is not present in this version of the file.

Event Kinematics
Invariant Mass (m_ll): > 12 GeV
Dilepton pT (pT_ll): > 30 GeV
MET (pT_miss): > 20 GeV
Higgs Transverse Mass (mT_H): > 60 GeV
Lepton 2 Transverse Mass (mT_L2): > 30 GeV


4. Trigger Selection (HLT)

Events must pass at least one of the following Cross-Triggers:
HLT_Mu12_TrkIsoVVL_Ele23_CaloIdL_TrackIdL_IsoVL_DZ
HLT_Mu23_TrkIsoVVL_Ele12_CaloIdL_TrackIdL_IsoVL_DZ
